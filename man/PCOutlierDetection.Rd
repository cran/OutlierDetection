\title{Principal Component Outlier Detection(Intersection of all the methods applied on pc's)}
\usage{
PCOutlierDetection(x, k = 0.05 * nrow(x), cutoff = 0.95,
  Method = "euclidean", rnames = FALSE, depth = FALSE,
  dense = FALSE, distance = FALSE, dispersion = FALSE,
  infocut = 0.9)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{dataset for which outliers are to be found}

\item{k}{No. of nearest neighbours to be used for for outlier detection using bootstrapping, default value is 0.05*nrow(x)}

\item{cutoff}{Percentile threshold used for distance, default value is 0.95}

\item{Method}{Distance method, default is Euclidean}

\item{rnames}{Logical value indicating whether the dataset has rownames, default value is False}

\item{depth}{Logical value indicating whether depth based method should be used or not, default is False}

\item{dense}{Logical value indicating whether density based method should be used or not, default is False}

\item{distance}{Logical value indicating whether distance based methods should be used or not, default is False}

\item{dispersion}{Logical value indicating whether dispersion based methods should be used or not, default is False}

\item{infocut}{Amount of variation for deciding the no. of principal components to be retained in the analysis, default is 0.9}
}
\value{
Outlier Observations: A matrix of outlier observations

Location of Outlier: Vector of Sr. no. of outliers
}
\description{
Takes a dataset, and finds its outliers based on principal components using combination of different method
}
\details{
OutlierDetection finds outlier observations for the principal component space using different methods and based on all the methods considered, labels an observation as outlier(intersection of all the methods). For bivariate data, it also shows the scatterplot of the data with labelled outliers.
